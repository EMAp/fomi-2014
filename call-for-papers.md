Workshop on Formal Ontologies meet Industry
http://empa.fgv.br/fomi-2014/

22 September, 2014 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Paper submission deadline: May 22, 2014 (extended to May 30)

AIMS AND SCOPE

FOMI is an international forum where academic researchers and
industrial practitioners meet to analyse and discuss application
issues related to methods, theories, tools and applications based on
formal ontologies. There is today wide agreement that knowledge
modelling and the semantic dimension of information plays an
increasingly central role in networked economy: semantic-based
applications aim to provide a framework for information and knowledge
sharing, reliable information exchange, meaning negotiation and
coordination between distinct organizations or among members of the
same organization. Often, theoretical ideas seem very promising but
their actual implementation brings up unexpected problems and
issues. The FOMI 2014 Workshop aims to collect useful experiences and
lessons learned by the presentation of:

- Experience with problems in ontology application.
- new insights on known problematic issues.
- new results, successes and observations in ontology implementation.
- lessons learned on the best way to apply ontological methodologies
  to real situations.

FOMI 2014 will facilitate open discussion and experience sharing. Very
similar problems arise in disparate ontology applications and an open
discussion helps to highlight commonalities and to spread ideas for
possible solutions. For this reason, FOMI welcomes researchers and
practitioners that embrace this perspective without restrictions on
the domain they deal with: business, medicine, engineering, finance,
law, biology, geography, electronics, etc.
